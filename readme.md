XENOARCHEOLOGY

You are conducting an archeological excavation on a dead alien planet.
You have Three tools to work with the Shovel the Trowel and the Brush.
The Shovel moves dirt faster but it is likely to damage any artefacts,
the brush is the Slowest tool but wont damage finds and the trowel
falls in the middle.You have 10 action points representing the amount
of excavation work you can undertake in a day. Once you are out of action
points night falls. At night you have to defend your site against evil
alien metal detectorists hell bent on looting your stuff. .


There are Three excavation tools:

     Shovel - heaviest tool digs fast but its easy to break artiefacts

     Trowel - medium tool less likely to break artefacts not too slow

     brush - very slow but wont break anything

Use the excavation tools on the Marked excavation area to find Weapons and
powerups to help defend your site you have 10 action points to work with
each time you use one of your tools it consumes an action point. Once all
the action points are used the work day ends and you must prepare to defend
your site from the alien metal detectorists who want to steal all of your finds.
